Reward is enough -- *when can we "reinforce" the learning?*

*This blog post is summarizes the papers **Settling the Reward Hypothesis**\[^1\] and **Utility Theory for Sequential Decision Making** \[^2\].*

The **reward hypothesis** is at the core of Reinforcement Learning (RL) in that whether sequential action problems can be posed as some sort of a reward maximization. One of the founders of modern RL, Richard S. Sutton, puts it as\[^3\]:
\> "That all of what we mean by goals and purposes can be well thought of as maximization of the expected value of the cumulative sum of a received scalar signal (reward)."

In some ways, it conveys sufficiency of RL's capabilities, especially in modeling decision problems. It is often even called *the reinforcement learning hypothesis*. The conceptual basis of the hypothesis can be traced to von Neumann-Morgenstern (vNM) utility axioms from the foundational work for modern game theory: Theory of Games and Economic Behavior\[^4\]. While vNM deals with when can an agent's rational behavior can be a result of maximizing the expectation of some utility function (the utility function must exhibit Completeness, Transitivity, Continuity, and Independence), vNM does not impose any structure to the said utility function.

Interactive Python Example

The following code demonstrates a simple, interactive data visualization using the `plotly` library, which is commonly used in data science contexts.

#\| label: reward-hypothesis-plot
#\| fig-cap: "The scatter plot visualizes the hypothetical relationship between reward signal intensity and learning agent performance over time. Hover over the points to see the specific data."

import pandas as pd
import plotly.express as px
import numpy as np

Create some hypothetical data

data = {
'Time (steps)': np.linspace(0, 100, 20),
'Reward Signal': np.random.uniform(5, 10, 20),
'Agent Performance': np.random.uniform(0, 10, 20) + np.linspace(0, 5, 20)
}
df = pd.DataFrame(data)

Create an interactive scatter plot with hover information

fig = px.scatter(
df,
x='Time (steps)',
y='Agent Performance',
size='Reward Signal',
color='Reward Signal',
hover_data=\['Reward Signal'\],
title='Hypothetical Agent Performance vs. Time'
)

fig.show()
